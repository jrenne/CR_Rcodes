# Replication package for "An Analytical Framework to Price Long-Dated Climate-Exposed Assets"

**Authors:** Pauline Chikhani and Jean-Paul Renne  
**Corresponding Author:** [Jean-Paul Renne](mailto:jean-paul.renne@unil.ch)  
**Version:** July 2025

## Overview

This repository contains the code necessary to replicate the results of the paper titled "[An Analytical Framework to Price Long-Dated Climate-Exposed Assets](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3881262)."

---

## Requirements

The analysis published in the paper has been conducted using R version 4.3.1 (2023-06-16) -- "Beagle Scouts."

### Instructions to Replicators

To replicate the results, execute the script `main.R`. 
   - The script begins by calibrating `mu_T` using the bisection method, which takes approximately 30 seconds.
   - Within `main.R`, you have the option to generate specific tables and figures, with detailed instructions included as commented code. By default, the code produces all the figures and tables in the paper.
   
### Libraries

Ensure that all necessary libraries referenced in `main.R` are installed prior to running the code. Libraries needed: parallel, doParallel, mgcv, colorspace, broman, optimx, MASS, expm.

### Runtime and Storage Requirements

- On a setup with a 2.3 GHz 8-Core Intel Core i9 processor, all figures and tables (including those in the supplemental materials) can be generated in about 15 minutes. Depending on the setup, approximate time needed to reproduce the analyses on a standard (2025) desktop machine: 10-30 minutes
- Approximate storage space needed: < 5 MBytes

### Controlled Randomness

Random seed is set:

- at line 9 of program make_figure_gamma0_distri.R. This script produces the figure illustrating the gamma0 distribution (Figure 9).
- within function `compute.SCC.Lemoine`; this function is included in the script `procedures/functions_other_models.R`. This function utilizes Lemoine (2021) model to compute yields and Social Cost of Carbons (SCC). It is used in `outputs/make_figures/make_figure_YC_RF.R` to produce Figure 6 (yield curves) and Figure VI.2 (Term structure of temperature risk premiums).
- The other results of the paper are not based on pseudo-random number generators (PRNGs).


---

## Directory Structure

The repository is organized into several folders, detailed as follows:

1. **data/**: Contains data files used for calibration and plotting.
2. **estimations/**: Contains R scripts for estimating and calibrating the model.
3. **outputs/**: Includes scripts for producing figures and tables, along with the generated outputs (see table below).
4. **procedures/**: Contains various procedures used to solve the model, price assets, and generate outputs.

The main directory includes **main.R**, that is the primary script to source for replicating the paper's results.


### List of Tables and Figures Produced by the Codes

The provided code reproduces the tables and figures in the paper, including those in the supplemental appendix. The exception is Figure 1, which is a schema created using the TikZ package in LaTeX. Tables 3, 4, and 6 are also exceptions; they contain formulas written directly in LaTeX.

All scripts used to generate figures are located in the folder `outputs/make_figures/`. All scripts for producing tables are in `outputs/make_tables/`. The resulting figures are saved in PDF format within the folder `outputs/Figures/`, and all tables are written in LaTeX and stored as `.txt` files in `outputs/Tables/`.

### Details on creation of intermediary files

The two CSV files `RCP_Mat_ACE.csv` and `RCP_Mat_MAGICC.csv` were created by appending the following lines to the end of the script `TempFitSim_ACE.m`, available in [Traeger´s (2023) replication package](https://www.openicpsr.org/openicpsr/project/154141/version/V1/view). Running this script in MATLAB generates the CSV files and saves them in the current directory.

```matlab
M_AT = [MagiccOcean.RCP3PD.Carboncycle(:,5) ...
    MagiccOcean.RCP45.Carboncycle(:,5) ...
    MagiccOcean.RCP6.Carboncycle(:,5) ...
    MagiccOcean.RCP85.Carboncycle(:,5)];

T_AT = [MagiccOcean.RCP3PD.Tempatm ...
    MagiccOcean.RCP45.Tempatm ...
    MagiccOcean.RCP6.Tempatm ...
    MagiccOcean.RCP85.Tempatm];

E_CO2 = [MagiccOcean.RCP3PD.EmissionCO2(:,1) + MagiccOcean.RCP3PD.EmissionCO2(:,2) ...
    MagiccOcean.RCP45.EmissionCO2(:,1) + MagiccOcean.RCP45.EmissionCO2(:,2) ...
    MagiccOcean.RCP6.EmissionCO2(:,1) + MagiccOcean.RCP6.EmissionCO2(:,2) ...
    MagiccOcean.RCP85.EmissionCO2(:,1) + MagiccOcean.RCP85.EmissionCO2(:,2)];

RF = [MagiccOcean.RCP3PD.RFtot ...
    MagiccOcean.RCP45.RFtot ...
    MagiccOcean.RCP6.RFtot ...
    MagiccOcean.RCP85.RFtot];

M = [MagiccOcean.RCP3PD.Year M_AT T_AT E_CO2 RF];
csvwrite('RCP_Mat_MAGICC.csv', M);

M = [(Startdate:timestep:Enddate)' Temp_combined_plot_atm_sim(:,[1 3 5 6])];
csvwrite('RCP_Mat_ACE.csv', M);
```
The file `IRF_Traeger_5y.csv` was created by adding the following line to the end of the script `ImpulseResponseComplot_ACE.m` in [Traeger´s (2023) replication package](https://www.openicpsr.org/openicpsr/project/154141/version/V1/view). Running this script in MATLAB generates the CSV file and saves it in the current directory.

```matlab
csvwrite("IRF_Traeger_5y.csv",[ACE_Impulse_DICE5' ACE_Impulse_Joos5']);
```

The `.Rdat` file `Figure223_EPA_data.Rdat` was generated by adding the following line to the end of the script `plot_temperature_anoml.R`, available in the replication package of Tan et al. (2024) at [https://github.com/bryanparthum/schfc-paper/tree/main](https://github.com/bryanparthum/schfc-paper/tree/main). (Specifically, this R script is available [here](https://github.com/bryanparthum/schfc-paper/blob/main/paper/code/Figure%203%20-%20temperature%20anomaly.R).)

The code line to add is:

```r
save(fair, hector, magicc, file="Figure223_EPA_data.Rdat")
```

The file `mu_DICE.csv` contains the trajectory of emission control rates extracted from the Excel file with outputs of the DICE2023 model. This Excel file is part of the [supplementary material](https://bit.ly/3TwJ5nO) associated with Barrage and Nordhaus (2024). It can be accessed directly via [this link](https://yale.app.box.com/s/whlqcr7gtzdm4nxnrfhvap2hlzebuvvm/file/1361579245945). The extracted series of emission control rates is located in row 71 of this Excel file, within the worksheet named `Opt`.
